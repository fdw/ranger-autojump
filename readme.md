# Ranger & Autojump

This plugin for ranger adds complete support for [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) to [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger):
Whenever a new directory is opened in ranger, autojump is notified and can change the weights accordingly.
Using `:j` you can use autojump to jump to a directory and if [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is found in the PATH, you will be able to browse through the directory proposals. This is made even better by adding `map cj console j%space` to your `rc.conf`. Thus typing `cj dirname` will let you jump to dirname.

As an added bonus, there is a zsh plugin introducing a new function called `r`. Without arguments, it just opens ranger. If you supply an argument that is a directory, ranger is opened in that directory. But if you supply anything else as an argument, `autojump` is called with the argument and `ranger` is opened there ðŸ§™

If you want similar functionality for [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide), you can try [ranger-zoxide](https://github.com/fdw/ranger-zoxide).

# Maintenance Mode
As autojump seems to be unmaintained and there's not really any features missing, this repo exists as-is. I will still look at PRs and issues, but don't expect too much.

If you want similar functionality for [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide), you can try [ranger-zoxide](https://github.com/fdw/ranger-zoxide).

# Installation
### Ranger plugin

- Add the following mapping to your `rc.conf` for convenience:
	```
	map cj console j%space
	```

### vim plugin (optional extra)
- To use autojump with vim, the [autojump.vim](https://github.com/trotter/autojump.vim) plugin can be installed. This can also be integrated with ZSH as shown below.

### zsh plugin

	- [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom):
		-	`zgenom load fdw/ranger_autojump`
	- [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen):
		-	`antigen bundle fdw/ranger_autojump@main`
	- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh):
		1. Clone this repository into oh-my-zsh's plugin directory:

			 ```
- (Optional) For vim integration add the following convenience function to your .zshrc:
